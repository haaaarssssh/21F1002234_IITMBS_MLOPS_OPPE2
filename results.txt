--- Model Explainability Analysis (Task 2) ---
This plot shows the features that have the most impact on the model's prediction.
Features pushing the prediction higher (towards 'no heart disease') are in red,
and features pushing it lower (towards 'heart disease') are in blue.

**Plain English Explanation of Factors for 'No Heart Disease' Prediction:**

Based on the SHAP summary plot, the factors most influential in predicting that a patient *does not* have heart disease are:
1.  **'ca' (Number of major vessels colored by flourosopy):** A low value (e.g., 0) is a strong indicator of no heart disease.
2.  **'thal' (Thalassemia):** A value of 2 ('normal') strongly suggests the absence of heart disease.
3.  **'cp' (Chest Pain Type):** Lower values for chest pain type are associated with a higher likelihood of not having heart disease.
4.  **'oldpeak' (ST depression induced by exercise):** A low 'oldpeak' value is a significant predictor for the 'no heart disease' class.
Conversely, high values for these features strongly push the prediction towards having heart disease.

--- Fairness Analysis (Task 3) ---

Metrics grouped by age group:
           accuracy  selection_rate
age_group                          
21-40         1.000        0.200000
41-60         0.975        0.375000
61-80         1.000        0.571429

Demographic Parity Difference: 0.3714

**Explanation:** Demographic Parity requires that the selection rate (the proportion of individuals predicted to have heart disease)
is the same across all age groups. A value of 0 is perfectly fair. Our value indicates a disparity in prediction rates between the
age groups with the highest and lowest selection rates.
